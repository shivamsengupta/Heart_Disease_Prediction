# Heart Disease Prediction

Welcome to the Heart Disease Prediction project! This project focuses on predicting heart disease using various machine learning models and data analysis techniques.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Predict the presence or absence of heart disease based on relevant features.
- **Key Insights**: Utilize seaborn visualizations to identify which features contribute most to heart disease.

## Data Preprocessing

- **Feature Engineering**: Perform feature engineering to enhance the predictive power of the dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Apply techniques such as feature scaling and encoding categorical variables (dummy variables) to prepare the data for modeling.

## Machine Learning Models

- **Model Fitting**: Fit different machine learning models, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting

- **Model Comparison**: Evaluate the performance of these models based on accuracy scores and F1-scores.

## Results

After conducting model comparison, the best-performing model was the **Random Forest** model, which achieved an accuracy of 85% and an F1-score of 0.85.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can find them listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

3. Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to reproduce the analysis and train the models.

4. Explore the model results, visualizations, and insights.

## Future Work

Consider the following for future improvements:

- Hyperparameter tuning to further enhance model performance.
- Exploring additional features or data sources to improve prediction accuracy.
- Deployment of the best-performing model for real-world applications.
